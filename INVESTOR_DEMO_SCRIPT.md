# 🚀 PropelAI - 5-Minute Investor Demo

**Welcome!** This walkthrough shows PropelAI's game-changing capability: **asking questions about an RFP in the context of YOUR company's capabilities and experience.**

---

## 🎯 What Makes This Different?

**Generic AI (ChatGPT/Claude):**
- Only knows what's in the RFP
- Can't tell you if YOU can win it

**PropelAI:**
- Uploads YOUR company docs (capabilities, past performance, resumes)
- Uploads the RFP
- **Answers: "Do WE have the right experience?"**
- **Answers: "Can WE meet these requirements?"**
- **Provides: Gap analysis specific to YOUR company**

This is true **proposal intelligence** - not just document Q&A.

## ❓ Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: "Is this just ChatGPT with a wrapper?"**
A: No. PropelAI uses specialized prompts, multi-mode routing, and RAG architecture. ChatGPT can't:
- Detect RFP type automatically
- Cross-reference amendments
- Generate formatted compliance matrices
- Search company library + RFP simultaneously

**Q: "What about hallucinations?"**
A: Every answer includes source citations (page #, section). Users can verify. RAG prevents hallucinations by only using uploaded documents.

**Q: "Can it handle classified RFPs?"**
A: Current: Commercial cloud (FedRAMP in roadmap). For classified: On-prem deployment option available.

**Q: "What's your defensibility?"**
A: 
1. Specialized prompts (1,000+ lines of FAR logic)
2. Router architecture (6 modes)
3. Network effects (more RFPs → better training)
4. Integration lock-in (Deltek, GovWin)

**Q: "Who's the competition?"**
A: 
- **VisibleThread:** Compliance checking (we do extraction + chat)
- **Loopio:** RFP response automation (we do analysis + requirements)
- **Generic AI:** No specialization for government proposals
- **Current Process:** Manual (80% of market still uses Word/Excel)
